# Advanced Interaction Techniques and Technologies

Welcome to the Advanced Interaction Techniques and Technologies GitHub site.

This site contains all of the files you'll need for the practical classes on the module, each in its own git repository. Each class repository contains:

- The instructions for that class
- A template project that you can use to get started

The best way to access the projects is to copy them into your personal GitHub account as a repository and then clone this onto the computer you're working on. To do this, click the green "Use this template" button and follow the instructions GitHub provides.

If you're not familiar with git and GitHub, there's a tutorial explaining how we'll use it in the module in [this repository](https://github.com/UoY-IM-MPIE/mpie-git-tutorial) from the MPIE module that uses a similar approach.
